# Hello POMS

# install
Install the [Node Version Manager](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-node-js-with-nvm-node-version-manager-on-a-vps)

By running `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.11.1/install.sh | bash`

Install Node JS by running `nvm install 6` and `nvm use 6`
Install the latest NPM by running `npm install -g npm`

Run `npm install` to install all prerequisites.

NOTE (for Mac): there's now a dependency on xcode application (xcode-select seems not to be enough)

#Current versions:
nvm: 0.34.0
node: v6.14.4
npm: 3.10.10

# development

## coding guidelines (TEMP)

-   Group Angular modules by functionality
-   A module for each feature
-   A module for each reusable component (especially directives and filters)
-   And an application level module which depends on the above modules and contains any initialization code.

-  Filenames start with uppercase for controllers, directives etc
-  Unit test filenames end in ...Spec

-  Directives are prefixed with poms, e.g. pomsGreeter equals poms-greeter (in file Greeter.js)

## Run backend and frontend together
Checkout poms and follow the instruction to run it on your local machine

1. Run backend server on port 8071
2. Run frontend
`./watch-proxy`
3. Install ha-proxy 
`brew install haproxy`
4. Run proxy
`proxy/start.sh`


## check the current development
Run `./ watch-dev.sh` to build and run the current development version on `http://localhost:port` ( port defaults to 4000 )

## live reloading
Run `npm run watch:dev` and navigate to `http://localhost:port` ( port defaults to 4000 )
Any changes to the code are automatically reflected in your browser.

## API and signon hosts
If you want the server to run with different API and signon hosts you can override the
package config settings by setting environment variables as follows:

`NPM_CONFIG_APIHOST=http://poms-dev.omroep.nl NPM_CONFIG_SIGNONHOST=http://sso-dev.omroep.nl npm run watch:dev`

## https
The POMS gui can also run on https locally. To do so follow these steps
Use a secure API host when starting the server. For instance,  `NPM_CONFIG_APIHOST=https://poms-dev.omroep.nl`
Specifiy the paths to your local `server.key` and `server.crt` files as the following environment variables:
`SERVER_KEY_PATH`
`SERVER_CRT_PATH`
Use `npm run serve:dev-secure` with the above mentioned environment variables to start the gui and view in the browser over port `8448`
(Note: local `server.key` and `server.crt` kan be generated by `openssl req -new -sha256 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -keyout server.key -x509 -days 365 -out server.crt`)

Example:
`NPM_CONFIG_APIHOST=https://poms-dev.omroep.nl NPM_CONFIG_SIGNONHOST=https://sso-dev.omroep.nl SERVER_KEY_PATH=~/.secure/server.key SERVER_CRT_PATH=~/.secure/server.crt npm run serve:dev-secure`
(Note: running node scripts directly from the console like `npm run serve:dev-secure` wont work without defining `NPM_CONFIG_APIHOST` & `NPM_CONFIG_SIGNONHOST` )

## debug statements in your console

To show POMSUI debugging messages in the console we use a [debugging](https://www.npmjs.org/package/debug)
utility which can be initialised by running commandline commands like `DEBUG=pomsui your_command`.
This will allow all 'pomsui' namespaced debug messages to be output to the console.

# deployment

For now, run `npm run deploy:gulp` to generate just a hand full of files in the build/deploy folder.
